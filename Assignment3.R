#  This assignment will be graded using unit tests executed via the submit script that you run on your computer. To obtain the submit script, run the following code in R:
   source("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fscripts%2Fsubmitscript3.R")
   
#   Or you can download the script to your working directory (NOTE: You may need to rename the script to be "submitscript3.R"). Then source it locally via
#   source("submitscript3.R")
   
#   The first time you run the submit script it will prompt you for your Submission login and Submission password. 
#   These can be found at the top of the Programming Assignments page. To execute the submit script, type
   submit()
